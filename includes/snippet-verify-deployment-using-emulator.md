Verify the deployment of your bot by using the [Bot Framework Emulator](~/bot-framework-resources-emulator.md). 

> [!TIP]
> Enter the bot's HTTPS endpoint into the address bar of the Emulator. 
> If you built your bot by using the Bot Builder SDK, the endpoint should end with `/api/messages` 
> (i.e., *https://\<appname\>.azurewebsites.net/api/messages*).
