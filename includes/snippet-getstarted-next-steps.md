Once you've verified that your bot is functioning properly, you can share it with others by completing the tasks that are required to [Publish a bot](~/bot-framework-publish-overview.md):

- [Register](~/bot-framework-publish-register.md) your bot with the Bot Framework
- [Deploy](~/bot-framework-publish-deploy.md) your bot to the cloud
- [Configure](~/bot-framework-publish-configure.md) your bot to run on one or more conversation channels
- [Publish](~/bot-framework-publish-add-to-directory.md) your bot to the Bot Directory
