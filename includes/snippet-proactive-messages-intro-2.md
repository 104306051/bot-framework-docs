An **ad hoc proactive message** is the simplest type of proactive message. 
The bot simply interjects the message into the conversation whenever it is triggered, 
without any regard for whether the user is currently engaged in a separate 
topic of conversation with the bot and will not attempt to change the conversation in any way. 

A **dialog-based proactive message** is more complex than an ad hoc proactive message. 
Before it can inject this type of proactive message into the conversation, 
the bot must identify the context of the existing conversation and decide how (or if)
it will resume that conversation after the message interrupts.
