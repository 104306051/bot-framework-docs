# Make your bots smarter
> [!WARNING]
> This content is under development.

You can add smarts to your bots and make them more useful and engaging for your users. An intelligent bot has human-like senses and skills. It understands what users are saying or writing in natural language and respond back. 

Bots respond as if they can see the world as people see it. They discover information and extract knowledge from different sources to provide useful answers, and, best of all, they learn as they acquire more experience to continuously improve their capabilities. 

## About Microsoft Cognitive Services
Microsoft Cognitive Services lets you tap into an ever-growing collection of powerful AI algorithms developed by experts in the fields of computer vision, speech, natural language processing, knowledge extraction, and web search. The services simplify a variety of AI-based tasks, giving you a quick way to add state-of-the-art intelligence technologies to your bots with just a few lines of code. The APIs integrate into most modern languages and platforms. The APIs are also constantly improving, learning, and getting smarter, so experiences are always up to date.

> You can find comprehensive documentation of each product and their corresponding API references on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/documentation" target="_blank">Cognitive Services documentation site</a>.

## Language understanding
The interaction between users and bots is mostly free-form, so buts need to understand language naturally and contextually. The Cognitive Service Language APIs provide powerful language models to determine what users want, to identify concepts and entities in a given sentence, and ultimately to allow your bots to respond with the appropriate action. The five APIs support several text analytics capabilities, such as spell checking, sentiment detection, language modeling, and extraction of accurate and rich insights from text. 

Cognitive Services provides five APIs for language understanding.

The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/language-understanding-intelligent-service-luis" target="_blank">Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)</a> is able to process natural language using pre-built or custom-trained language models.

The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/text-analytics-api" target="_blank">Text Analytics API</a> detects sentiment, key phrases, topics, and language from text.

The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/bing-spell-check-api" target="_blank">Bing Spell Check API</a> provides powerful spell check capabilities, and is able to recognize the difference between names, brand names, and slang.

The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/linguistic-analysis-api" target="_blank">Linguistic Analysis API</a> uses advanced linguistic analysis algorithms to process text, and perform operations such as breaking down the structure of the text, or performing part-of-speech tagging and parsing.

The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/web-language-model-api" target="_blank">Web Language Model (WebLM) API</a> can be used to automate a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as word frequency or next-word prediction, using advanced language modeling algorithms.

## Image and video understanding
The Vision APIs bring advanced image and video understanding skills to your bots. 
State-of-the-art algorithms allow you to process images or videos and get back information you can transform into actions. For example, you can use them to recognize objects, people's faces, age, gender or even feelings. 

The Vision APIs support a variety of image understanding features. They can identify mature or explicit content, estimate and accent colors, categorize the content of images, perform optical character recognition, and describe an image with complete English sentences. The Vision APIs also support several image and video processing capabilities, such as intelligently generating image or video thumbnails, or stabilizing the output of a video.

> [!TIP]
> You can play with the popular <a href="https://www.captionbot.ai/" target="_blank">CaptionBot.ai</a> to see some of the Vision APIs in action. If you want to explore more, you can find detailed documentation about each API, including developer guides and API references, on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/documentation" target="_blank">documentation site</a>.

Cognitive Services provide four APIs you can use to process images or videos:

#### Computer Vision API
The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api" target="_blank">Computer Vision API</a> extracts rich information about images (such as objects or people), determines if the image contains mature or explicit content, and processes text (using OCR) in images.

#### Emotion API
The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api" target="_blank">Emotion API</a> analyzes human faces and recognizes their emotion across eight possible categories of human emotions.

#### Face API
The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-api" target="_blank">Face API</a> detects human faces, compares them to similar faces, and can even organize people into groups according to visual similarity.

#### Video API
The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/video-api" target="_blank">Video API</a> analyzes and processes video to stabilize video output, detects motion, tracks faces, and can generate a motion thumbnail summary of the video.

## Get started
You can sign up for free trials with an email and a few <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up" target="_blank">simple steps</a>. You will need a Microsoft Account if you don't already have one. You will receive a unique pair of keys for each API requested. The second one is just a spare. Do not share the secret keys with anyone. Trials have both rate limit (in terms of transactions per second or minute) and a monthly usage cap. A transaction is the same as an API call. You can upgrade to paid tiers to unlock the restrictions.
