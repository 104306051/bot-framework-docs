If you develop on the Bot Framework platform, you may already know how easy it is to connect your bot to new channels like Microsoft Teams and Cortana (coming soon). 
You probably also know the variety of experiences these channels offer their users – rich cards, multimedia, and interactivity options. 
The Channel Inspector (an interactive web tool you can use to browse the features in each chat client) enables you to see how those features look and work on each platform. 
Even if you’re developing your bot for only one channel, the Channel Inspector makes it easy to understand the style your users will see and limitations in the platform.
