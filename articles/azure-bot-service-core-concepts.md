# Core concepts of the Azure Bot Service

The Azure Bot Service simplifies bot development. You can build, connect, deploy and manage intelligent bots quickly that interact naturally wherever your users are talking, whether it's with an app or website, Text/SMS, Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Kik, Office 365 mail, or other popular services. 

Azure hosts the conversational logic for your bot. This means you can get a bot talking to your users with minimal coding, testing, and downtime.

With the Azure Bot Service, you can take advantage of the these features: 

- Accelerate bot development by working in an integrated environment thatâ€™s purpose-built for bot development.
- By using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/">Azure Functions</a>, your bot will run in a server-less environment on Azure that will scale based on demand.
- You can increase the value of your bots with a few lines of code by plugging into <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-US/sign-up?ReturnUrl=/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions" target="_blank">Cognitive Services</a>. This enables your bots to see, hear, interpret and interact in more human ways.
- Using the online Azure editor, you can code your bot in C# or Node.js without any need for a tool chain (local editor and source control). The integrated chat window sits side-by-side with the Azure editor so that you can test your bot on the fly as you write the code in the browser.


## Bot templates

[Bot templates](~/azure-bot-template-overview.md) will get you started quickly building your first bots with Azure Bot Service. They contain everything you need to write, test, and deploy your bots. All you have to do is add your custom code that makes the bot unique and engaging for your customers to talk to.

Follow a [step-by-step tutorial](~/azure-bot-service-getstarted.md) so that you can quickly build and test a simple bot.
