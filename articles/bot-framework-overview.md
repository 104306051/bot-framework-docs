#What is the Bot Framework?

The Microsoft Bot Framework is a comprehensive offering that you use to build and deploy high quality bots for your users to enjoy wherever they are talking. The framework consists of the Bot Builder SDK, Bot Connector, Developer Portal, and Bot Directory. There's also an emulator that you can use to test your bot.

A bot is a web service that interacts with users in a conversational format. Users start conversations with your bot from any channel that you've configured your bot to work on (for example, Text/SMS, Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, and other popular services). You can design conversations to be freeform, natural language interactions or more guided ones where you provide the user choices or actions. The conversation can utilize simple text strings or something more complex such as rich cards that contain text, images, and action buttons.

The following conversation shows a bot that schedules salon appointments. The bot understands the user's intent, presents appointment options using action buttons, displays the user's selection when they tap an appointment, and then sends a thumbnail card that contains the appointment's specifics.

Bots (or conversation agents) are rapidly becoming an integral part of one’s digital experience – they are as vital a way for users to interact with a service or application as is a web site or a mobile experience. Developers writing bots all face the same problems: bots require basic I/O; they must have language and dialog skills; and they must connect to users – preferably in any conversation experience and language the user chooses. The Bot Framework provides tools to easily solve these problems and more for developers e.g., automatic translation to more than 30 languages, user and conversation state management, debugging tools, an embeddable web chat control and a way for users to discover, try, and add bots to the conversation experiences they love.
