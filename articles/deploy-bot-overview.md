# Deploy a bot to the cloud

After you have built and tested your bot, you need to deploy it to the cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> If you built your bot using the Azure Bot Service, you don't need to register or deploy your bot.
> Bot registration and deployment are handled as part of the Azure Bot Service bot creation process.

## Deploy your bot to the cloud

Before others can use your bot, you must deploy it to the cloud. You can deploy it to Azure or to any other cloud service. These articles describe various techniques for deploying your bot to Azure: 

- [Deploy from a local git repository](~/deploy-bot-local-git.md) using continuous integration
- [Deploy from GitHub](~/deploy-bot-github.md) using continuous integration
- [Deploy from Visual Studio](~/deploy-bot-visual-studio.md)

## Next steps
* [Register and publish a bot](portal-register-bot.md)
* [Configure a bot to run on one or more channels](~/portal-configure-channels.md).
