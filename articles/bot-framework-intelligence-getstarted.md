# Add smarts to your bots with Microsoft Cognitive Services

You can add smarts to your bots and make them more useful and engaging for your users. An intelligent bot has human-like senses and skills. It understands what users are saying or writing in natural language and respond back. 

Bots respond as if they can see the world as people see it. They discover information and extract knowledge from different sources to provide useful answers, and, best of all, they learn as they acquire more experience to continuously improve their capabilities. 


## About Microsoft Cognitive Services
Microsoft Cognitive Services lets you tap into an ever-growing collection of powerful AI algorithms developed by experts in the fields of computer vision, speech, natural language processing, knowledge extraction, and web search. Here's what else they can do.

- The services simplify a variety of AI-based tasks, giving you a quick way to add state-of-the-art intelligence technologies to your bots with just a few lines of code. 

- The APIs integrate into most modern languages and platforms. 

- The APIs are also constantly improving, learning, and getting smarter, so experiences are always up to date. 

Simply drop the API call into your botâ€™s code and you are set. You can find more information and code samples to start developing bots with cognitive skills in the articles of this section.

> [!TIP]
> You can find comprehensive documentation of each product and their corresponding API references on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/documentation" target="_blank">Cognitive Services documentation site</a>.

## Get started
You can sign up for free trials with an email and a few <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up" target="_blank">simple steps</a>. You will need a Microsoft Account if you don't already have one. You will receive a unique pair of keys for each API requested. The second one is just a spare. Do not share the secret keys with anyone. Trials have both rate limit (in terms of transactions per second or minute) and a monthly usage cap. A transaction is the same as an API call. You can upgrade to paid tiers to unlock the restrictions.

## Subscription management
Once you are signed in with a Microsoft Account you will be able to access your <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions" target="_blank">subscriptions page</a> to show the products you are using, the quota remaining, and additional products you can add to your subscription.

## Upgrade to unlock limits
All the APIs will have a free trial plan. As paid offerings become available for each API you will be directed to the Azure portal to complete the purchase. Find **Buy** links in your Subscriptions page if you are already using them or you can skip the trial altogether and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/pricing" target="_blank">purchase the API service</a>. 

You will need to set up a Azure subscriber account with a credit card and a phone number. For the first time subscriber you get a $200 discount (subject to change without notice). If you have a special requirement or simply want to talk to someone first, click **Contact us** at the top the Pricing page.
