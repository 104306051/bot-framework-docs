The Bot Builder Node.js SDK is a powerful framework for constructing bots that can handle both freeform interactions and more guided ones where the possibilities are explicitly shown to the user. 
It is easy to use and models frameworks like Express & Restify to provide a familiar way for JavaScript developers to write bots.

In this walkthrough, we'll take a detailed look at the process of developing, testing, deploying, publishing, and configuring a bot that is created using the Bot Builder Node.js SDK.

**Key features:**
- Powerful dialog system with dialogs that are isolated and composable.
- Built-in prompts for simple things like Yes/No, strings, numbers, enumerations.
- Built-in dialogs that utilize powerful AI frameworks like LUIS.
- Bots are stateless which helps them scale.
