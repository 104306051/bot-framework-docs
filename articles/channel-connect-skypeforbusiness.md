# Connect a bot to Skype for Business

Skype for Business Online keeps you connected with co-workers and business partners through instant messaging, phone, and video calls. Extend this functionality by building bots that users can discover and interact with through the Skype for Business interface.

> [!NOTE]
> The Skype for Business Bot Framework channel is currently supported for Skype for Business Online.Â Skype for Business Server 2015 is not supported. 

## Enable the channel

Open the bot on the [Bot Framework Portal](https://dev.botframework.com/), click the **Channels** tab, and then click **Skype for Business**. The bot is now enabled. 

Registering the bot with Skype for Business Online is performed by a **Tenant Administrator** of that Skype for Business tenant.
