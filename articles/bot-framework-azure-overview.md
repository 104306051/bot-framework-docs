# Bot Builder for Azure

The Azure Bot Service is a powerful, easy-to-use framework that provides a familiar way for to write bots. You can build, connect, deploy and manage intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking, whether it's with an app or website, Text/SMS, Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Kik, Office 365 mail, or other popular services. 

The conversational logic for your bot is hosted on Azure and is powered by Microsoft Bot Framework. This means you can get a bot talking to your users with minimal coding, testing, and downtime.

Using the Azure Bot Service, you can take advantage of the following features: 

- Accelerate bot development by working in an integrated environment thatâ€™s purpose-built for bot development.
- By using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/">Azure Functions</a>, your bot will run in a serverless environment on Azure that will scale based on demand.
- You can also increase the value of your bots with a few lines of code by plugging into <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-US/sign-up?ReturnUrl=/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions" target="_blank">Cognitive Services</a> to enable your bots to see, hear, interpret and interact in more human ways.
- Using the Azure editor, you can write your bot in C# or Node.js without any need for a tool chain (local editor and source control). The integrated chat window sits side-by-side with the Azure editor so that you can test your bot on the fly as you write the code in the browser.
