# General Bot Review Guidelines

We welcome you and thank you for investing your talents and time in building bots using Microsoft’s Bot Framework. Following are the minimum requirements your bot must meet before it may be published to a Microsoft channel such as Skype, Bing and Cortana.  Each channel may have specific guidelines in addition to the requirements detailed below.  If applicable, you’ll find channel specific guidelines on each channel’s configuration page.
Microsoft will review your bot submission to make sure it meets certain minimum requirements before it  may be available on a directory. Following are some criteria we use to evaluate your bot before publication:
1)	Your bot must do something meaningful that adds value to the user (e.g., respond to basic commands, have at least some level of communication etc.).

2)	The bot profile image, name, keywords and description must NOT:
a)	be offensive or explicit;
b)	include third party trademarks, service marks or logos;
c)	impersonate or imply endorsement by a third party;
d)	use names unrelated to the bot;
e)	use Microsoft logos, trademarks or service marks unless you have permission from Microsoft; or
f)	be too long or verbose. The description should be 8-10 words.

3)	For payment enabled bots:

a)	Your bot may not transmit financial instrument details through the user to bot interface;
b)	Subject to any channel or third party platform restrictions, your bot may: (a) support payments through the [Microsoft Seller Center](http://seller.microsoft.com) subject to the terms of the [Microsoft Seller Center Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=841553); or (b); transmit links to other secure payment services;  
c)	If your bot enables the foregoing payment mechanisms, you must disclose this in your bot’s terms of use and privacy policy (and any profile page or website for the bot) before the end user agrees to use your bot;
d)	You must clearly indicate that the bot is payment-enabled in the bot profile and provide end users with the merchant’s customer service details; and
(e) You may not publish bots on any Microsoft channel that include links or otherwise direct users to payment services for the purchase of digital goods.


4)	Your Terms of Service link is required for submission and publication to all Microsoft channels. If your bot handles users' personal data you must also provide a link to an applicable privacy policy, and such privacy policy must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and policy requirements. In addition, you will need to ensure that you follow the privacy notice requirements as communicated in the Developer Code of Conduct for the Microsoft Bot Framework referenced here: https://aka.ms/bf-conduct.

5)	Your bot must operate as described in its bot description, profile, terms of use and privacy policy, and you must notify Microsoft in advance by sending an email to bf-reports@microsoft.com, if you make any material changes to your bot. Microsoft has the right, in its sole discretion, to intermittently review bots on any channel and remove bots without notice.
6)	Microsoft reserves the right to dismantle a channel’s bot directory at any time without notice.
7)	Your bot must operate in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Microsoft Bot Framework Online Services Agreement and Developer Code of Conduct for the Microsoft Bot Framework.  In addition, your bot must meet the applicable requirements for each channel upon which your bot is published.
8)	Changes made to your bot's registration may require your bot to be re-reviewed to ensure that it continues to meet the requirements stated here.
9)	Although Microsoft will review your bot to confirm it meets certain minimum requirements prior to publication, you are solely responsible for:
a)	your bot;
b) 	its content and actions;
c)	compliance with all applicable laws;
d) 	compliance with any third party terms and conditions; and
e) 	compliance with the Microsoft Bot Framework Online Services Agreement, Privacy Statement and Developer Code of Conduct for the Microsoft Bot Framework.
10)	Microsoft's review and publication of your bot to  a channel’s bot directory is not an endorsement of your bot.
11)	Keep your Microsoft Account email active as we will use that for all bot-related communication with you.
