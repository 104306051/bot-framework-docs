## Introduction

When users ask your bot for something, like "help" or "find news", your bot needs to understand what the user is asking for. 
You can design your bot to recognize a set of intents that interpret the userâ€™s input in terms of the intention it conveys.
This article demonstrates how to register a custom intent recognizer that runs each time the bot receives a message from the user. 
Custom recognizers return a named intent that can be used to trigger actions and dialogs within the bot.


## Example: Register a custom intent recognizer
This example adds a recognizer that determines if the user says 'help' or 'goodbye'. A bot can also have a 
recognizer that determines if the user sends an image, or calls an external web service to determine the user's intent.

Once you've registered a recognizer, you can associate the recognizer with an action using a `matches` clause.
