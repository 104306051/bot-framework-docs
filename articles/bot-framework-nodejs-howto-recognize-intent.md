When the users ask your bot for something, like "help" or "find news", your bot needs to understand what the user is asking for. 
You can design your bot to recognize a set of intents that interpret the userâ€™s input in terms of the intention it conveys.
This article demonstrates how to register a custom intent recognizer that will be run for every message received from the user. 
Custom recognizers can return a named intent that can be used to trigger actions and dialogs within the bot.


## Example: Register a custom intent recognizer
This specific example adds a recognizer that looks for the user to say 'help' or 'goodbye' but you could easily add a 
recognizer that looks for the user to send an image or calls an external web service to determine the user's intent.


[!code-js[Add a custom recognizer (Javascript)](../includes/code/node-howto-recognize-intent.js#addCustomRecognizer)]

Once you've registered a recognizer, you can associate the recognizer with an action using a `matches` clause.
