The Azure Bot Service can accelerate your bot's development by working in an integrated environment that is purpose-built for bot development. 

In this walkthrough, we'll take a detailed look at the process of developing, testing, deploying, publishing, and configuring a bot that is created using the Azure Bot Service.

**Key features:**
- Integrated environment lets you build, connect, deploy and manage intelligent bots. 
- You can write your bot in C# or Node.js directly in the browser using the Azure editor without any need for a tool chain (local editor and source control). 
- The integrated chat window sits side-by-side with the Azure editor, which lets you test your bot on the fly as you write the code in the browser.
