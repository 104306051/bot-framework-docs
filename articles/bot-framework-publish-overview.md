# Publish a bot

Once you've developed a bot and are ready share it with others, complete the following steps:

1. [Register](bot-framework-publish-register.md) your bot with the Bot Framework
2. [Deploy](bot-framework-publish-deploy.md) your bot to the cloud
3. [Configure](bot-framework-publish-configure.md) your bot to run on one or more conversation channels
4. [Publish](bot-framework-publish-add-to-directory.md) your bot to the Bot Directory

> [!NOTE]
> Step 1 (Register your bot) and Step 2 (Deploy your bot) are not applicable for bots that are created by using the Azure Bot Service, since those tasks are included within the functionality that the Azure Bot Service provides.
