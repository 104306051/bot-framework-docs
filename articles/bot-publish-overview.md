# Publish a bot

Once you've developed a bot and are ready share it with others, complete the following steps:

1. [Register](bot-publish-register.md) your bot with the Bot Framework
2. [Deploy](bot-publish-deploy.md) your bot to the cloud
3. [Configure](bot-publish-configure.md) your bot to run on one or more conversation channels
4. [Publish](bot-publish-add-to-directory.md) your bot to the Bot Directory

> [!NOTE]
> If you've created your bot by using the Azure Bot Service, you can skip Step 1 (Register your bot) and Step 2 (Deploy your bot), since these tasks are encapsulated within the functionality that the Azure Bot Service provides.
