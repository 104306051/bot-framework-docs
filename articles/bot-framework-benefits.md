# How the Bot Framework helps you

The Microsoft Bot Framework provides just what you need to build and connect intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services.

![Bot Framework Diagram](http://docs.botframework.com/en-us/images/faq-overview/botframework_overview_july.png)

To build your bot, the Framework provides a [.NET SDK](/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/) and [Node.js SDK](/en-us/node/builder/overview/). These SDKs provide features such as dialogs and built-in prompts that make interacting with users much simpler. For those using other languages, see the frameworkâ€™s [REST API](/en-us/connector/overview/). The Bot Builder SDK is provided as open source on GitHub (see [BotBuilder](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder)).

To give your bot more human-like senses, you can incorporate LUIS for natural language understanding, Cortana for voice, and the Bing APIs for search. For more information about adding intelligence to your bot, see [Bot Intelligence](/en-us/bot-intelligence/getting-started/).
