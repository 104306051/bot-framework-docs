# Explore rich cards with the Web Chat control
Many messaging channels provide the ability to attach richer objects. The Bot Framework has the ability to render rich cards as attachments. There are several types of cards supported: `Adaptive Card`, `Hero Card`, `Thumbnail Card`, `Receipt Card`, `Sign-In Card`, `Animation Card`, `Video Card` and `Audio Card`. Once the desired card type is selected, it is mapped into an `Attachment` data structure.

This bot renders several types of cards as attachments, while also showing the generated JSON for each one of these cards at the message's payload, and the C# and NodeJs code required to build them.
