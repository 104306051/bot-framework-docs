The Bot Framework State service enables your bot to store and retrieve state data that is associated with a user, a conversation, or a specific user within the context of a specific conversation. 
State data can be used for many purposes, such as determining where the prior conversation left off or simply greeting a returning user by name. If you store a user's preferences, you can use that information to customize the conversation the next time you chat. For example, you might alert the user to a news article about a topic that interests her, or alert a user when an appointment becomes available.
