If you are building a bot for Skype, 
you may choose to enable your bot to communicate with users via audio call. 
The ability to support audio calls can be useful in scenarios where the user does not want to 
(or simply cannot) provide input by typing text or clicking buttons. 

> [!NOTE]
> A bot may be designed to support audio call as the only means of communicating with users, 
> or may be designed to support audio call in addition to other more traditional means of communicating with users, 
> such as rich user controls, text, etc.
