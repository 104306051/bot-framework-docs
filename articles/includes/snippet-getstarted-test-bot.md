Next, test your bot by using the [Bot Framework Emulator](~/debug-bots-emulator.md) to see it in action. 
The emulator is a desktop application that lets you test and debug your bot on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel. 

First, you'll need to download and install the emulator. 
Click [here](https://emulator.botframework.com/) to download the emulator, 
then launch the executable and complete the installation process.
