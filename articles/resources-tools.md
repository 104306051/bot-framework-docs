# Bot Framework tools
Building bots can be easier and more fun with the help of additional tools.

## Bot Framework Emulator

The [Bot Framework Emulator](resources-emulator.md) is a desktop application that lets you test and debug your bot.

## Vorlon.js and Bot Framework Inspector

[Vorlon.js](http://vorlonjs.io) is a remote debugging tool for JavaScript code. You can use it to inspect any bot created in Node.js ([read why and how](http://aka.ms/botinspector)). With it, you can easily see your dialog stacks and understand what is happening inside of your bot.
