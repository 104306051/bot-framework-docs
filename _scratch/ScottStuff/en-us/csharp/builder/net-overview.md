<span style="color:red">This needs to be the top-level .NET topic. </span>

Bot Builder for .NET is a powerful framework for constructing bots that can handle both free-form interactions and more guided conversations where the user selects from possible values. 

The following are some of the high level features of the SDK.

* Powerful dialog system with dialogs that are isolated and composable
* Built-in prompts for simple things such as Yes/No, strings, numbers, and enumerations
* Built-in dialogs that utilize powerful AI frameworks like [LUIS](http://luis.ai){:target="_blank"}
* Bots that are stateless which helps them scale
* Bots that can run on almost any bot platform such as the [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://botframework.com){:target="_blank"}, [Skype](http://skype.com){:target="_blank"}, and [Slack](http://slack.com){:target="_blank"}
