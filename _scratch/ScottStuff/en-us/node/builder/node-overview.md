<span style="color:red">This needs to be the top-level Node topic.</span>

Bot Builder for Node.js is a powerful framework for constructing bots that can handle both free-form interactions and more guided conversations where the user selects from possible values. It is easy to use, and it models frameworks such as Express and Restify to provide developers with a familiar way to write bots.

The following are some of the high level features of the SDK.

* Powerful dialog system with dialogs that are isolated and composable
* Built-in prompts for simple things such as Yes/No, strings, numbers, and enumerations
* Built-in dialogs that utilize powerful AI frameworks like [LUIS](http://luis.ai){:target="_blank"}
* Bots that are stateless which helps them scale
* Bots that can run on almost any bot platform such as the [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://botframework.com){:target="_blank"}, [Skype](http://skype.com){:target="_blank"}, and [Slack](http://slack.com){:target="_blank"}
