Before your bot gets added to the Bot Directory, Microsoft will review it to make sure it meets the following requirements. At the end of the review, Microsoft will send you an email with the results of the review. If the review was successful, Microsoft adds your bot to the directory; otherwise, the email message will list the issues that you need to resolve before resubmitting it.

1. Your bot must do something meaningful that adds value to the user, it may not simply echo the user's input.

2. The bot's profile image, name, hastags and description must NOT:   
- Be offensive or explicit (see [Developer Code of Conduct](https://aka.ms/bf-conduct))  
- Include third party trademarks, service marks or logos   
- Impersonate or imply endorsement by a third party   
- Use names unrelated to the bot   
- Use Microsoft logos, trademarks or service marks unless you have permission from Microsoft   
- Be too long or verbose. The description may not exceed 512 characters.

2. Microsoft Bot Framework does not currently support payments within bots. Your bot may not transmit financial instrument details through the bot interface. However, your bot may provide links to secure payment services but you must disclose this in your bot's terms of use and privacy policy (and any profile page or website for the bot) before a user agrees to use your bot.

3. Your Terms of Service link is required for submission and publication to the Bot Directory. If your bot handles users' personal data, you must also provide a link to an applicable privacy policy that is in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and policy requirements. In addition, you will need to ensure that you follow the privacy notice requirements as communicated in the [Developer Code of Conduct](https://aka.ms/bf-conduct) for Microsoft Bot Framework.

4. The bot must operate as described in its description, profile, terms of use and privacy policy. You must notify Microsoft in advance if you make any material changes to your bot. Microsoft has the right, in its sole discretion, to intermittently review bots in the Bot Directory and remove bots from the directory without notice.

5. Your bot must operate in accordance with the requirements set forth in the [Online Services Agreement](http://aka.ms/bf-terms) and Developer Code of Conduct for the Microsoft Bot Framework.

6. Changes made to your bot's registration may require your bot to be reviewed again to ensure that it continues to meet the requirements stated here.

7. Although Microsoft will review your bot to confirm it meets certain minimum requirements prior to publication on the Bot Directory, you are solely responsible for: (1) your bot; (2) its content and actions; (3) compliance with all applicable laws; (4) compliance with any third party terms and conditions; and (5) compliance with the Online Services Agreement, Privacy Statement and Developer Code of Conduct for the Microsoft Bot Framework. Microsoft's review and publication of your bot to the Bot Directory is not an endorsement of your bot.
