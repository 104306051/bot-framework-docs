Now that you've written your bot and added it to one or more [channels](/en-us/channels/), it's time to publish it to the Bot Directory and Skype apps. The [directory](https://bots.botframework.com/){:target="_blank"} is a public directory of all bots that were registered and published with Microsoft Bot Framework. Users can select your bot in the directory and add it to one or more of the configured channels that they use.

But first, we need to do a quick review of your bot. For information about the review process, see [Bot Review Guidelines](/en-us/directory/review-guidelines/). You should review the guidelines before submitting your bot for review to ensure that it complies with the guidelines. If your bot passes review, itâ€™s added to the directory. 

The bot's dashboard provides the status of the publishing process. The status transitions from Unavailable to In review to Published as the bot moves through the publishing process.

To publish your bot:

1. Go to the [developer portal](https://dev.botframework.com) and click **My bots**. 
2. Select the bot that you want to publish from your list of registered bots.
3. On your bot's dashboard, click **Publish**.

You have the option to update the icon, name, and description that you provided when you registered your bot. If you've already provided this information and there are no changes, you can skip to the next section.

1. Upload a PNG image that represents your bot in the conversation. The icon is limited to 30 KB.
2. Update your bot's name. This is the name that's used in Bot Directory. The name is limited to 35 characters.
3. Update the bot's description. The description is displayed in the directory so it needs to describe what your bot does. The description is limited to 512 characters. The first 46 characters are displayed on your bot's card in the directory, and the full description is displayed in your bot's details page.

Next, we need details about you, the publisher.

1. Provide your company's name. Required.
2. Provide a monitored email address. It's important that you provide a monitored email address because this is where we'll send all correspondance. 
3. Provide the URL to your bot's privacy statement.
4. Provide the URL to your bot's terms of use.
5. Optionally, provide the URL to your bot's webpage.
6. Optionally, provide a comma-delimited list of hashtags. The list of hashtags is limited to 2,000 characters.
7. Optionally, provide a comma-delimited list of ISO 639-1 language codes (for example, `en` for English) that identify the languages that your bot supports. 
8. Optionally, provide your bot's default language code. By default, bots support English.

Finally, provide any additional information that you think is relevant to the review process, turn on **Automatically show bot in directories after review**, and click **Submit for review**.

If you need to exit before providing all of the details, click **Save** so you don't have to start over.
