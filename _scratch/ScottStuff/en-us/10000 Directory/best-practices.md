### Provide as much value to the user as you can in the conversation channel

* Minimize bouncing the user out of the messaging canvas to other webpages and apps.

### Participate in a productive conversation in a natural way with minimal complexity

* Messages should be brief but meaningful with a bias towards text-based answers that can be understood at a glance; and card, image or button answers that are crisp, clear, actionable. Human-like typing speed.

### Utilize the interaction patterns of the messaging canvas and the mobile OS


* Use themes, UI, and an IA familiar to users. Users should know what to expect when they engage with bot (for example, tap on a photo).

### Have a clear POV on what scenarios the bot will handle brilliantly

* Know the user problem, your bot's value proposition, and how your bot is better than other currently available solutions.

### Craft an engaging welcome message

* Always introduce your bot to members of the chat.  
* Let users know how they can interact with your bot (for example, list the commands that your bot supports). 
* Engage users by requesting a response and then waiting for the user to respond before continuing the conversation.

### Emotion, variety and personality are vital

* Unless you want to deliberately project a robotic persona, make your bot colorful and rich in expression (for example, using different font-styles, emoticons, etc. in your bot's script). Keep responses varied, especially when the same topic or question comes up multiple times in a conversation. Over time, based on the tone and character of your bot, the user should build a character for your bot in their mind. 


### Be judicious with data and message frequency

* Don't send out a sequence of messages when they can be grouped into a single message. 
* Be mindful of the user's network-speed and bandwidth charges when sending images and/or videos. 
* Get the user's permission before doing something out of the ordinary (for example, sending 100 messages in the next minute or a large file). 
* Don't send out messages that might appear as spam (for example, wishing a user "Good night" at 10 PM every night). 

### Give feedback

* It's always good to give a sense of awareness to the user. Let the user know whether the bot understood the user's response. Paraphrase and/or confirm if the bot is uncertain about the user's intent, especially before performing more involved (or irrevocable) actions like deleting something permanently.  
* If the bot needs to perform time-intensive actions, give an indication to the user so they're not left wondering if something is wrong with the bot.  


### Keep the user in control

* The user must not feel constrained or forced by the bot's script. Let the user tailor the bot to suit their needs. For example, if the bot can send five updates but the user is only interested in two, let the user turn off updates for the other three. 
* Let the user select from options in your script wherever appropriate.  
  

### Be nice and do the right thing including but not limited to:
